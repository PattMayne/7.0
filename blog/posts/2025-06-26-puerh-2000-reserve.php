        This is a very nice balance between the beetjuice flavor of the 2003 reserve, with the fermented floral depths of the exquisite 2008 reserve. It's fruity, dark, and layered. I keep going back for another sip because my tongue wants to explore the hidden aspects of this exotic bouquet. A fantastic example of puerh's inexhaustible diversity of flavors.

        Is it a bit too sharp and sweet for a daily morning tea? Possibly. But just barely. It's a delight to drink.

        Leaning toward the floral (like beets and roses) while the dark forest-floor aspect takes a back seat and provides a basement for the more-dominant flavors. There isn't much mushroom in this murky broth. But there is a ton of flavor.
