		Some puerh tea is dank as a fermented bog. This <i>vintage</i> isn't quite so extreme. In fact it's the most mellow variety of puerh I've tried. It still hits you with that peat musk, dark as the best coffee (without the bitterness <strong>or</strong> the acidity), slightest fungal twang of rich mushroom, but smooth with age. It's the aging that softens dark tea's natural bite. Puerh <i>shou</i> is "artifically" fermented (induced to ferment quickly) for a shorter period of time than its <i>sheng</i> counterparts, but then it's cooked a little (unlike sheng) and left to age without further fermentation, mellowing.

		It's a good tea. But in all honesty, I wouldn't recommend it over the other varieties I've tried. Unless you really want minimal flavor. It might be the smoothest (and least dank) puerh of which I've partaken.
