        Like Darth Vader, this drink is more fermentation than tea. That's not entirely a bad thing. The musk isn't too pungent. Where some other puerh's have a fruity or floral aspect to balance the dank, this one packs some pepper. It's the only one I've tried that I'd call <i>spicy.</i> It's tasty. Not exactly <i>delicious,</i> but certainly enjoyable.

        The earthy notes are muted. It's not like drinking the forest floor, but instead like fermented Dr. Pepper. There aren't a lot of layers. This has fewer notes, so they shine through more clearly.

        Aged since 1991, this is the oldest tea I've tried so far. Maybe that's why I can't taste much tea behind the tang. It faded away, like Anakin Skywalker's humanity. Leaving behind nothing but the peppery darkness. But that darkness is why we keep coming back.
