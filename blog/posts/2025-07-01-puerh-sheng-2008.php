        Welcome to flavor country. This puerh <i>sheng</i> has been fermenting naturally since 2008. Its musk is deep, not like forest floor or mushroom (which define my favorite puerh <i>shou</i> varieties), it's a dry-dank flavor like aged apple cider, <i>sans tartness</i>, with undertones of white wine. My other favorite puerh's are dark in color and flavor, but this is soft and delicate like a white tea, beneath the refined pungent fermentation, and just packed with layers of flavor.

        It's really a delicious tea. The natural fermentation is totally distinct from the "artificial" fermentation I'm used to from the shou varieties. Those are more dark, more in-your-face.

        The combination of delicate subtlety and tongue-dominating pungent dankness makes this a novelty where each layer of flavor is delicious. Truly a prestigious and exotic tea.
