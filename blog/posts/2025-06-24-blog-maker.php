        Oh, so he's going to waste our time poasting about tea on his little blog?

        Finally, a self-created (and self-owned (to the extent that anything online can be user-owned)) "BLOG" (or diary).

    <P>
        It's written in PHP. No database, no need to log in. I'll add posts as PHP snippets, and update everything else either manually or with the XML sheets which replace the hassle of MySQL. I like doing it manual, simple, bare-bones.
    </P>

    <p>
        Everything else is overkill. I write novels and stories, but I want to sell those. I don't write substack-style articles. So on the rare occasion that I wish I had a blogspace, well here it is. Actually I might store recipes here, and reviews of various teas.
